# 🏥 Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard

An interactive **end-to-end dashboard** designed to analyze and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) for a **Hospital Emergency Room (ER)**.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The dashboard provides actionable insights into patient flow, wait times, satisfaction levels, and referral patterns in the ER.  
It is built with **MS Excel** (can also be adapted to Power BI / Tableau), and leverages interactive visualizations to assist healthcare management in decision-making.

## 🎯 KPIs & Features
The following KPIs and charts were implemented:

1. **Number of Patients**  
   - Daily ER visits  
   - Trend analysis with area sparkline  

2. **Average Wait Time**  
   - Average time patients wait to see a medical professional  
   - Trends to identify bottlenecks  

3. **Patient Satisfaction Score**  
   - Average daily satisfaction rating  
   - Spot drops in satisfaction & link to busy times  

4. **Patient Admission Status**  
   - Admitted vs. Not Admitted  

5. **Patient Age Distribution**  
   - Group patients by age brackets  

6. **Timeliness**  
   - Percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes  

7. **Gender Analysis**  
   - Number of male vs. female patients  

8. **Department Referrals**  
   - Most common referral departments

## 📊 Insights & Findings
- **Peak ER traffic** identified during late evenings.  
- **Wait times** are longer on weekends, requiring staffing adjustments.  
- **Satisfaction scores** drop during peak hours, indicating service bottlenecks.  
- **Pediatrics and Cardiology** are the most referred departments.  
- **Timeliness metric** showed only 68% of patients were seen within 30 minutes – improvement opportunity.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **MS Excel** for dashboard & visualization  
- **Excel / CSV** dataset for ER data  
- **DAX measures** for KPI calculations
